### Personal Data
We don't collect any personal data from your device. Everything you do is saved into your iCloud and is synced across your devices using the same iCloud account.

When you use our software we may record some usage analytics and crash logs. The sole purpose of the data we collect is to help us make better decisions on where to focus our efforts and improve our software.

### Usage analytics
The app usage analytics collected is minimal but essential to help us run our business. Currently we collect:

Application starts/ends.
Device locale.
In-App Purchases.
Device type, CPU architecture, and version of the operating system.
We use Crashlytics to collect and manage this data. You may opt-out of collecting this data inside the application.

### Crash logs
Crash logs are, by default, automatically sent on the next app start. These logs contain anonymised data about the crash that can help us identify the cause and potentially provide a fix in a future update. These logs do not contain any data or metadata about the content you create with our software. Here’s what’s collected:

Anonymized bundle identifier, and short bundle version string of your app.
Device type, CPU architecture, and version of the operating system.
Timestamp when the crash happened.
A generated UUID to prevent duplicate crash reports.
If an exception was thrown, the plain-text class name and message value of the exception.
Low level crash data like instruction pointer, method or function names, signal data, pointer registers, and information about the loaded binary images.
The application log file.
We use Crashlytics to collect and manage this data. You may opt-out of collecting this data inside the application.

### Any questions?
If you have any questions at all, about your data or any other query, kindly contact us support@2stable.com We are happy to answer everything.

*Your complete satisfaction is our number one priority. Please tell us if anything falls short of your expectations so we can actually do something about it, regardless of these rules. Nothing is set in stone, and we are open to making adjustments.*
